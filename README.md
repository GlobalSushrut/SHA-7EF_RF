## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from fpcs import FRH, ARH, CSB, QuantumInspiredKey

# Initialize components
frh = FRH()
arh = ARH()
csb = CSB()
key_gen = QuantumInspiredKey()

# Generate a quantum-inspired key
key, entropy = key_gen.generate_key()

# Hash data using FRH and ARH
data = b"Your sensitive data"
frh_hash = frh.hash(data)
arh_hash = arh.hash(data)

# Apply chaotic substitution
encrypted = csb.substitute(data)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/test_fpcs.py
```
